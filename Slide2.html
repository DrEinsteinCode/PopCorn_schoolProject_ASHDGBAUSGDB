      There are three things in a corn seed that makes do popcorn. Those are an impermeable shell called pericarp, right water content and starch. When we heat popcorn kernels, the water inside of them forms steam and start to expand. While the starch turns into a gel-like substance. Being enclosed the expanding steam applies pressure on the shells. Eventually when the shells cannot hold the pressure, they burst open releasing the steam and gel. When this gel comes in contact with air, it rapidly solidified forming fluffy popcorn.
