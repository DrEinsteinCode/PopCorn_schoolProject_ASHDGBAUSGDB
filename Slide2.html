      here are three things in a corn seed that makes do popcorn. The first one is a impermeable shell called pericarp that contain the two other things to do popcorn water and starch. When we heat popcorn kernels, the water inside of them forms steam and start to expand. Min while the starch turns into a gel-like substance. Being enclosed the steam start to press pressure to the shells. Then when the shells cannot hold the pressure, they open  the steam and gel. Finally when the gel comes out, the air immediately solidified it forming fluffy popcorn.
